<p>This app was created using React, Framer-motion, Material-UI and CSS-module.</p>
<p>It's an app for a fashion agency to display their contents</p>
<p>It fetches content data from a util file. This file contains some data objects needed for page renderings.
</p>
<p>The form on the contact page has some verifications to it which dynamically renders a modal depending if it encounters an error or was submitted successfully</p>
